    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>Once complete, this website will allow Monash Students to see who’s in their class, contact class members and also compare timetable with friends. Additionally it will allow students to make notes together as a class, share notes with class members or just organise and backup notes on Google Drive.</p>

    <p>If you answer yes to any of these, it will be for you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Are my friends with me in any of the classes I’m enrolled in?</li>
        <li>When can I catch up with my friends at uni?</li>
        <li>Just curious to know who’s in your class in advance?</li>
        <li>I didn't get the class I wanted, I wish I could swap my class times.</li>
        <li>Wish I could make notes together with my peers in classes?</li>
        <li>Organise and backup notes on Google Drive?</li>
        <li>Share and review notes with others studying the same unit?</li>
        <li>Want to try out something awesome?</li>
    </ul>

    <!--<p><i>Coming soon, currently being made with love.</i></p>-->


    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>We are three first year students who started studying at Monash this Feburary.
        There are a lot of things we can learn from each other. Learning with friends can be more collaborative and fun.<br>
    The prototype of the product was developed at presented at the Unihack Mini 2017 (22 April) competition. Since then
    the only way it can go is forwards.</p>
